Steps into building the program are as follows: 
    Build a Number guessing game, in which the user selects a range.
    Letâ€™s say User selected a range, i.e., from A to B, where A and B belong to Integer.
    Some random integer will be selected by the system and the user has to guess that integer in the minimum number of guesses
